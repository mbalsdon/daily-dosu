- TODO
--- other modes support
----- got 429'ed while requesting token; have all threads use same wrapper/token? watch out for concurrency
----- testing (run on mock; also see if we can use that for prod)

--- clean up metadata functions (use iterator or sth)
--- update to cpp20, update libraries (dpp making valgrind cry)
--- compiler optimizations ([[nodiscard]], noexcept)
--- job: highest plays today (or something)
----- https://github.com/Ameobea/osutrack-api ("Get the best plays by pp for all users in a given mode")
----- better to just grab recent tops from those w/ highest rank gain?
----- how to format output? probably Xth actionrow for swapping between "jobs" (newsletter pages)
--- job: anyone who broke a digit range (X reached 2 digit)
