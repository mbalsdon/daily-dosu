------- download osr (e.g. GET https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1497268101/download , this is public but maybe try through api route https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html#get-apiv2scoresscoredownload)
------- convert to video https://github.com/Wieku/danser-go (osr to mp4?)
------- can video be included in discord embed? else just put in raw message
