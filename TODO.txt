- TODO
--- improve country input
----- store alpha2, alpha3, and full name; maps to alpha2; match against it in modal
----- if unrecognized, direct the user to a help command; dms them all countries directly
----- rmbr to update modal desc

--- other modes support
--- clean up metadata functions (use iterator or sth)
--- filter by playstyle ferda?
--- update to cpp20, update libraries (dpp making valgrind cry)

- MAYBE
--- new jobs
----- highest plays today (or something)
------- https://github.com/Ameobea/osutrack-api
------- "Get the best plays by pp for all users in a given mode"
------- better to just grab recent tops from those w/ highest rank gain?
----- anyone who broke a digit range (X reached 2 digit)
----- how to format this? second action row with left/right buttons which switch between job embeds (incl. first action row)?
------- look through supported components
--- bot makerequest if necessary
----- takes fn as param
----- spawn thread for fn param s.t. each req is executing/retrying concurrently
----- on err (5xx), thread yield if delay time (exponential backoff) hasn't passed
--- optimize scrapeRankings more if bored
----- add directly inserts to txn and commit after join, instead of writing to vector and re-reading
----- chunking inserts with multivalue syntax
