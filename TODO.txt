- TODO

--- getTopPlays

----- decouple classes from libraries ((osu&topplays&tokens)->httprequester->curl, (rdbm&bcdbm&tpdbm)->db->sqlitecpp)
------- bot/embedgenerator newsletter-specific fns? e.g. scrapeRankingsX, topPlaysX
----- organize files
----- readme
----- ctrlF
----- COMMIT

----- parallelize

----- clean up metadata functions (regex good enough)
----- LOG_ERROR_THROW replace some of the arg check->runtime error throws
----- compiler optimizations (const&, [[nodiscard]], noexcept)
----- underscore private functions
----- ctrlF
----- COMMIT

----- video embedding: o!rdr or doing it ourselves?
------- doing ourselves:
------- get scoreID: https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html#get-a-user-beatmap-scores (else, try matching thru their tops/recents?)
------- download osr (e.g. GET https://osu.ppy.sh/scores/1497268101/download , this is public but maybe try through api route https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html#get-apiv2scoresscoredownload)
------- convert to video https://github.com/Wieku/danser-go (osr to mp4?)
------- can video be included in discord embed? else just put in raw message
--------- be wary of workload; compress or increase ratelimit?

----- test (run for few days, try from weird states, etc.)
------- fix
------- ctrlF
------- COMMIT

----- pushhh
------- need to add DISCORD_BOT_STRINGS to dosu_config
------- need to wipe rankings.db on prod since performancePoints went from int -> float
------- need to update bot_config.db on prod since we added enabled/disabled newsletters

- FUTURE

--- threadpooling parallelized work
